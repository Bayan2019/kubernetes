# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a distributed system of servers that host software applications, and you interact with it primarily through your local command line - it's not a programming language.

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes orchestrates and manages collections of containers (often those created by Docker). 
It takes care of scaling, distribution, and connectivity among these containers.

## Install

The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. 
It's a client that communicates with a Kubernetes API server.
